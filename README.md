# wargm-b0x

This project contains a vagrant box for solving wargame challenges. Use this box instead of having to install the tools on your host system.

Currently the box contains the following tools:

- pwntools
- ropgadget
- peda-gdb

Additionally vim and ipython is added. 

A personalization step is included such that you can change the ``scripts/personalize.sh`` to setup your config files.

### Notes
tmux is also available. [Cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058)
