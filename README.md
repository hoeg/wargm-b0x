# wargm-b0x

This project contains a vagrant box for solving wargame challenges. Use this box instead of having to install the tools on your host system.

Currently the box contains the following tools:

- pwntools
- ropgadget
- peda-gdb

Additionally vim and ipython is added. 

Vim is a vanilla installation but I will add my own config and make it easy exhange it with your own.
